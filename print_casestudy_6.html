        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>To design a large-scale, 90-foot-long illustration for OSC Sri Lanka’s basketball court, centered on their gecko mascot. The project involved creating a cohesive, vibrant scene across five separate panels, each featuring geckos engaging in various sports activities. The aim was to enhance the court’s atmosphere with a dynamic, school-spirited visual that aligns perfectly across panels, delivering a seamless and energetic backdrop for students and visitors. This required close collaboration with the printing team to ensure precise edge alignment and consistency across all panels.</p>
