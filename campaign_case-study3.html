        <h2>Campaign Strategy</h2>
        <p class="expandable-text">The design strategy centered on visually impactful assets and cohesive brand materials across digital and print. I crafted vibrant social media content, eye-catching graphics, and launch creatives that stayed consistent with the brand’s adventurous spirit. The visuals were bold, designed to pop on social feeds and billboards alike, ensuring strong engagement. The <b>"Get Charged and Win"</b> promotion became a natural extension, incorporating a clear call to action that encouraged interaction and participation, making the launch not just a product debut but an experience.</p>

        <h2>Visual Impact and Results</h2>
        <p class="expandable-text">I used high-contrast designs and a bold monochrome and red color palette to create an energetic, modern look that resonated across digital and physical media. The campaign’s clean, dynamic visuals aligned seamlessly with Coca-Cola’s brand aesthetic, while the call to action—Get Charged—stood out, inviting audience participation. The campaign successfully generated buzz, building a strong market presence for Charged in the Maldives.</p>

        <h2>Promotion Highlights</h2>
        <p class="expandable-text">In the Get Charged and Win promotion, I introduced a tiered reward structure to keep the audience engaged throughout the month. The promotion included two grand prizes—Benelli bikes—along with daily giveaways to create sustained engagement. Through dynamic design elements and promotional materials, I emphasized the aspirational quality of the prizes, which appealed directly to the brand’s adventurous, thrill-seeking audience. This strategy effectively combined daily interactions with the anticipation of major rewards, fueling ongoing excitement and brand awareness.</p>
